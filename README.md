# About
### This project is an accessibility project for those who seek pair-programming partners to practice Data Structures & Algorithms. Users will be randomly paired on a first-in first-out basis where they will be able to share video cameras and chat with each other to discuss on solving the problem. The goal of this project is to have it community driven for users who have a hard time finding a partner to work on something with -- thus, will allow users to link up with the other, or go next.
