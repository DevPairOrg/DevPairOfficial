# Technology

### Front-end Technologies:
- React: A JavaScript library for creating dynamic user interfaces, essential for front-end web application development.
- Redux & @reduxjs/toolkit: Tools for managing and centralizing application state, commonly used with React to facilitate state management in complex applications.
- TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that introduces type safety and is often used to develop robust front-end and back-end applications.
### Back-end Technologies:
- Python: A high-level, versatile programming language for server-side logic, serving as the backbone for many web applications.
- Flask: A minimalist web framework for Python, providing the flexibility to build web applications quickly and with minimal setup.
- Flask-SocketIO: An extension for Flask that enables WebSocket support, facilitating real-time, bidirectional communication between the web client and server.
### Database Management:
- PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system used in production for its advanced features and reliability.
- SQLite: A lightweight, file-based database, ideal for development and testing environments due to its simplicity and ease of use.
- SQLAlchemy: An ORM and SQL toolkit for Python, providing a full range of patterns for database access and manipulation.
### Real-time Communication:
- Agora-RTC: A technology enhancing WebRTC with additional features for high-quality real-time voice and video communication, crucial for applications requiring live interaction.
### AI and Machine Learning:
- Google AI Gemini API: A cutting-edge API from Google AI, designed to provide advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. This could include anything from natural language processing, image recognition, to predictive analytics, significantly enriching the application's features and user experience.

# Getting Started

### Prereq:

- Agora-RTC
    1. Signup for [Agora-RTC](https://sso2.agora.io/en/v6/signup)
    2. Grab the `App ID`
    3. Grab the `App Certificate`
    4. Generate a temp `RTC Token`

- Gemini AI
    1. Grab the API key in Google AI Studio to utilize [GeminiAI](https://ai.google.dev/)

- Amazon Web Services S3
    1. Setup an [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
    2. Setup a `bucket`
    3. Grab the AWS `Key` and `Secret`

## Method 1: Use setup.sh script
- Run the install script in the terminal
    - `sh setup.sh`
        - This script will create a `.env` with necessary variables and values for the user to initialize the project and install all dependencies on the client and server.
- Terminal 1:
    - `cd into client`
    - In `.env`, set AppId, App Certificate, RTC Token.
    - `npm run dev`
- Terminal 2:
    - `cd into server`
    - In `.env`, set AWS S3 and Gemini API Key.
    - After setting the keys, in the terminal for /server, type `exit` (this is to re-enter the shell with the updated .env variables)
    - `pipenv shell`
    - `flask run`

## Method 2: Manual

### /server
- `cd` into the `server` folder
- Create a `.env` file with a key
    - `SECRET_KEY=<secret key>`
    - `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///dev.db`
    - `SCHEMA=<schema_name>`
- `pipenv install -r requirements.txt`
- `pipenv shell`
- `flask db migrate`
- `flask db upgrade`
- `flask seed all`
- `flask run`

### /client
- `cd` into the `client` folder
- Create a `.env` file and input the proper values. Refer to `.env.example`
- `npm i`
- `npm run build` in one terminal for typescript
- `npm run dev` in another terminal

# Enhancements / Prettier Settings
- `cd` into the `client` folder
- Create a `.prettierrc` file
- Recommended settings that offer an ideal balance for code readability and style:
    ```
    {
        "printWidth": 120,
        "tabWidth": 4,
        "singleQuote": true,
        "trailingComma": "es5",
        "bracketSpacing": true
    }
    ```
- It's important to note, however, that these settings are based on personal preference and might not be universally preferred. Adjustments can be made according to individual or team standards to better suit different coding styles or project requirements.

# Deployment

### Build Command
- `./build.sh`
- Inside build.sh
    ```
    #!/bin/bash

    # Stop the script if any command fails
    set -e

    # Navigate to the client directory and run npm commands
    echo "Installing client dependencies and building the client..."
    cd client
    npm install
    npm run start
    cd ..

    # Navigate to the server directory and run pip commands
    echo "Installing server dependencies and setting up the database..."
    cd server
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install psycopg2
    flask db upgrade
    flask seed all
    cd ..

    echo "Build and setup completed successfully!"
    ```

### Start Command
- `cd server && gunicorn -k gevent -w 1 app:app`

### Versions File
```
