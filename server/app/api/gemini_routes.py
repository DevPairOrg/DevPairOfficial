            Provide empty functions with names relevant to the problem.
            Include comments within the functions stating "Your code goes here."
            Include two separate functions -- one for python and one for javascript.
            Python: Use pass instead of a return statement within the empty function.
            JavaScript: Keep the function empty with just the comment and avoid using arrow functions. Do not use Python comment syntax for JavaScript (triple quotes).
            Parameters for both functions should not have a type assigned to them.

            INPUT: A detailed list of inputs needed to test the solution, with multiple parameters separated by commas. If there's a target, explicitly state it (e.g., "target=#").

            Important: Create a test in python based on the instructions provided below. The tests should all be relevant to the problem {name_and_prompt} response which you gave me in our previous conversation and test specifically for these {test_cases} you gave me.

            1. Python Testing:
            Do not use unittest
            Define test cases as an list of objects, each with input and expected output (these keys should be inside quotations).
            Iterate over test cases, executing the solution function with each input and using expression to compare the result to the expected output in order to return a boolean.
            Make sure to be consistent with input formatting (e.g., keep lists as lists, don't spread them).

            For solutions returning arrays:
            Implement a method to compare arrays by value and order using iteration and strict equality (===) for elements. Ensure the lengths are also equal.
            Use this method within console.assert to verify the expected array structure and content.

            Remember:
            Avoid using any markdown formatting like asterisks for bold text or backticks for code blocks.
            Maintain proper formatting for test case inputs and outputs.

            Follow the following example format:
