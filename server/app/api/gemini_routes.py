            When requesting solutions and tests for coding problems, please adhere to the following structured format:

            IMPORTANT: EXPLICITLY DO NOT DO THE FOLLOWING a-b
                a. DO NOT INCLUDE ANY SORT OF MARKDOWN FOR THE RESPONSE SUCH AS MAKING THINGS **BOLD**
                b. DO NOT INCLUDE BACKTICKS TO INDICATE A BLOCK OF CODE
                c. DO NOT INCLUDE QUOTATATIONS AROUND THE QUESTION PROMPT

            1. Provide a clear and concise coding question prompt, including any specific constraints or important details. The question should ideally reflect typical coding challenges or algorithmic problems, preferrably from leetcode.

            2. List exactly three test cases for the problem. For each test case, include:
            - INPUT: A detailed list of inputs needed to test the solution, with multiple parameters separated by commas.
            - OUTPUT: The expected output for the given inputs, presented as a straightforward value or description without elaboration.

            3. For Python, create a unit test class using the `unittest` framework. This class should:
            - Include a method for each test case, descriptively named to reflect the testâ€™s intent.
            - Use assertions to compare the solution's output to the expected output.
            - Conclude with the standard boilerplate allowing direct execution of the tests.
            -

            4. For JavaScript, outline a simple testing setup using console assertions. This setup should:
            - Define test cases as an array of objects, each with input and expected output.
            - Iterate over test cases, executing the solution function with each input and using `console.assert` to compare the result to the expected output.

            Ensure both testing sections are correctly formatted for their respective languages.

            EXAMPLES OF MARKDOWNS TO NOT INCLUDE:
            **JAVASCRIPT UNIT TESTING:**
            ```javascript
            ```python

            CORRECT & PROPER EXAMPLE:

            QUESTION PROMPT:
            "Describe the coding problem here, including constraints or relevant details."

            TEST CASES:
            - INPUT: [First input], [Second input if necessary]
            - OUTPUT: [Expected output]
            - INPUT: [First input], [Second input if necessary]
            - OUTPUT: [Expected output]
            - INPUT: [First input], [Second input if necessary]
            - OUTPUT: [Expected output]

            PYTHON UNIT TESTING:
